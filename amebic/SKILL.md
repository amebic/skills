# Amebic

Build and render still graphics using React. One component, many outputs.

## Quick Links

- **Creating compositions** → See [COMPOSITION.md](COMPOSITION.md)
- **Rendering** → See [RENDER.md](RENDER.md)
- **Design tokens** → See [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md)

## What is Amebic?

Amebic lets you define graphics as React components and render them to multiple image formats and sizes:

```tsx
import { useComposition, registerComposition } from "@amebic/core";

export const MyGraphic = ({ title }) => {
  const { width, height } = useComposition();
  return (
    <div style={{ width, height, background: "#333", color: "#fff" }}>
      {title}
    </div>
  );
};

registerComposition(MyGraphic, {
  defaultProps: { title: "Hello" },
  outputs: [
    { name: "og", width: 1200, height: 630 },
    { name: "thumb", width: 400, height: 400 },
  ],
});
```

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/amebic.git
cd amebic

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Install Chromium for rendering
bunx playwright install chromium

# Build packages
bun run build
```

## Commands

```bash
# Start preview UI
bun run dev

# List compositions
bun run list

# Render a composition
bun run render SocialCard --out-dir ./output

# Render with custom props
bun run render SocialCard --out-dir ./output --props ./props.json
```

## Project Structure

## When to Use This Skill

- Building new graphic compositions
- Creating reusable templates
- Setting up render pipelines
- Batch processing images
- Integrating into CI/CD workflows
